## About the ProjectðŸŒŸ

RoomVision is an innovative interior design assistant that leverages AI to analyze room images and provide personalized design suggestions. Built with a modern tech stack, this project allows users to upload images of their rooms, detect furniture, extract dominant colors, and receive recommendations for complementary decor items. The application integrates with the Hugging Face API for object detection and uses Sharp for color analysis, making it a powerful tool for interior design enthusiasts and professionals alike.

### Featuresâœ¨
- **Image Upload**: Drag and drop or browse to upload room images.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Detects furniture (e.g., sofa, chair, bed) using the Hugging Face DETR model.
- **Color Extraction**: Identifies dominant colors and generates complementary, analogous, and triadic color palettes.
- **Design Suggestions**: Provides tailored recommendations based on detected objects and color schemes.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, user-friendly interface.

### Tech StackðŸš€
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Image Processing**: Sharp
- **AI Integration**: Hugging Face API
- **Deployment**: Render
